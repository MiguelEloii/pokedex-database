A normalized PostgreSQL database project demonstrating database design, SQL proficiency, and QA testing methodologies.

## Project Overview

Built as part of my transition into Quality Assurance, this project showcases my ability to design relational databases, write complex SQL queries, and apply QA thinking to identify data integrity issues.

## Purpose

- Learn database normalization principles
- Practice writing complex SQL queries with JOINs
- Apply QA methodologies (exploratory testing, boundary testing, data validation)
- Build a portfolio piece demonstrating technical SQL skills

## Technologies Used

- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16
- **Tools:** DBeaver
- **Language:** SQL

## Database Schema

Visual representation of the database structure and relationships:

![Pokedex Database Schema](images/pokedex_schema_2.png)

The database consists of 7 interconnected tables:

### Core Tables
- **pokemon** - Basic Pok√©mon information (id, name, height, weight, legendary status)
- **types** - Master list of all Pok√©mon types (Fire, Water, Grass, etc.)
- **abilities** - Master list of abilities with descriptions
- **stats** - Individual stat values (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp.Attack, Sp.Defense, Speed)
- **evolutions** - Evolution chains and requirements

### Junction Tables (Many-to-Many Relationships)
- **pokemon_types** - Handles Pok√©mon with dual types (e.g., Charizard: Fire + Flying)
- **pokemon_abilities** - Connects Pok√©mon to their abilities, including hidden abilities

## ‚ú® Key Features

‚úÖ **Proper Normalization** - Data is organized to minimize redundancy and maintain integrity

‚úÖ **Referential Integrity** - Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records and invalid data

‚úÖ **Many-to-Many Relationships** - Junction tables properly handle complex relationships

‚úÖ **Data Validation** - Constraints ensure data quality (UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK)

‚úÖ **Self-Referencing Tables** - Evolutions table references the pokemon table twice

##  QA Testing & Findings

Applied exploratory and boundary testing methodologies to identify data integrity issues:

### Bugs Found

**BUG-001: Missing Constraint on Type Slots**
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Issue:** System allowed Pok√©mon to have more than 2 types (slots > 2)
- **Expected:** Pok√©mon should only have 1-2 types maximum
- **Root Cause:** Missing CHECK constraint on `pokemon_types.slot` column
- **Fix:** Add `CHECK (slot IN (1, 2))` constraint

### Sample Validation Queries
```sql
-- Find records with too many types (should be max 2)
SELECT pokemon_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM pokemon_types 
GROUP BY pokemon_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;

-- Find records with missing names
SELECT * FROM pokemon WHERE name IS NULL;

-- Find records with invalid stats (negative values)
SELECT * FROM stats WHERE hp < 0 OR attack < 0;

-- Find duplicate entries
SELECT pokemon_id, type_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM pokemon_types 
GROUP BY pokemon_id, type_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## Complex Query Examples

### Show Pok√©mon with Their Types
```sql
SELECT 
    p.name AS pokemon_name,
    STRING_AGG(t.type_name, ', ' ORDER BY pt.slot) AS types
FROM pokemon p
JOIN pokemon_types pt ON p.id = pt.pokemon_id
JOIN types t ON pt.type_id = t.id
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY p.name;
```

**Example Output:**
| pokemon_name | types |
|--------------|-------|
| Bulbasaur | Grass, Poison |
| Charizard | Fire, Flying |
| Charmander | Fire |
| Pidgey | Normal, Flying |

---

### Display Evolution Chains
```sql
SELECT 
    p1.name AS evolves_from,
    p2.name AS evolves_to,
    e.evolution_level,
    e.evolution_method
FROM evolutions e
JOIN pokemon p1 ON e.pokemon_id = p1.id
JOIN pokemon p2 ON e.evolves_to_id = p2.id
ORDER BY p1.name;
```

**Example Output:**
| evolves_from | evolves_to | evolution_level | evolution_method |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Bulbasaur | Ivysaur | 16 | level_up |
| Charmander | Charmeleon | 16 | level_up |
| Charmeleon | Charizard | 36 | level_up |
| Ivysaur | Venusaur | 32 | level_up |

---

### Find All Fire-Type Pok√©mon with Stats
```sql
SELECT 
    p.name AS pokemon_name,
    s.hp,
    s.attack,
    s.defense
FROM pokemon p
JOIN pokemon_types pt ON p.id = pt.pokemon_id
JOIN types t ON pt.type_id = t.id
JOIN stats s ON p.id = s.pokemon_id
WHERE t.type_name = 'Fire'
ORDER BY s.attack DESC;
```

**Example Output:**
| pokemon_name | hp | attack | defense |
|--------------|-----|--------|---------|
| Charizard | 78 | 84 | 78 |
| Charmeleon | 58 | 64 | 58 |
| Charmander | 39 | 52 | 43 |
